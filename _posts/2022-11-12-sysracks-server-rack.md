[![Best Server Rack for Your HomeLab? Sysracks Enclosed Rack!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/plwhD5tRsGM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plwhD5tRsGM "Best Server Rack for Your HomeLab? Sysracks Enclosed Rack!")

I've been on a quest looking for a new server rack for my HomeLab in my home.  I've outgrown my current 18u open frame rack and decided to give a 32u Sysracks Enclosed Rack a try!  Join me as we put together this server rack, test out all of the features, and I'll let you know my thoughts about this brand new server rack!
