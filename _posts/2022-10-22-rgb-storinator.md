My Storinator server from 45Drives is great, except for 1 thing.  It's a little loud for my home.  It would be fine if it were in a data center or a real network closet, however this is in my basement.  I decided to swap out all the fans to make it quieter, and install RGB fans along with a ZigBee controller so I can control them with Home Automation!
